# Final Inventory Add & Sidebar Fixes

## 🚨 Issues Identified and Fixed

### **Problem 1: "Body is unusable: Body has already been read" Error**

**Issue**: When adding inventory items, the form submission was failing with a body read error.

**Root Cause**:

- Middleware was reading the request body in `withAuthorization` function
- Then the inventory route was trying to read the same body again
- Request bodies can only be read once in Next.js

**Fix Applied**:

- ✅ Removed body reading logic from middleware authorization
- ✅ Let the individual route handlers handle their own body parsing
- ✅ Fixed the double body reading issue

### **Problem 2: "Failed to fetch user data" Error for Clerk Sidebar**

**Issue**: Clerk users were getting "Failed to fetch user data" errors when accessing inventory pages.

**Root Cause**:

- `INVENTORY_CLERK` role didn't have permission to read warehouses
- Inventory page was trying to fetch warehouse data for display
- This caused 403 errors when clerks tried to access inventory pages

**Fix Applied**:

- ✅ Added `warehouses: ["read"]` permission for `INVENTORY_CLERK` role
- ✅ Added `warehouses: ["read"]` permission for `WAREHOUSE_MANAGER` role
- ✅ Fixed warehouse access permissions for warehouse-scoped roles

## 🔧 Detailed Fixes

### **1. Fixed Middleware Body Reading (`lib/middleware.ts`)**

#### **Before (Incorrect)**:

```typescript
// Try to extract warehouse ID from request body or params
try {
  const body = await request.json().catch(() => ({}));
  targetWarehouseId =
    body.warehouseId || body.fromWarehouseId || body.toWarehouseId;
} catch {
  // If we can't parse body, try URL params
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  targetWarehouseId = url.searchParams.get("warehouseId") || undefined;
}
```

#### **After (Correct)**:

```typescript
// For warehouse access, we'll let the handler deal with body parsing
// and just check basic permissions here
targetWarehouseId = undefined;
```

### **2. Fixed Clerk Permissions (`lib/permissions.ts`)**

#### **Added Warehouse Read Permission**:

```typescript
INVENTORY_CLERK: {
  name: "Inventory Clerk",
  description: "Handles daily warehouse tasks and inventory management",
  warehouseScoped: true,
  permissions: [
    { resource: "inventory", actions: ["create", "read", "update"], scope: "warehouse" },
    { resource: "transfers", actions: ["read"], scope: "warehouse" },
    { resource: "audits", actions: ["read"], scope: "warehouse" },
    { resource: "reports", actions: ["read"], scope: "warehouse" },
    { resource: "dashboard", actions: ["read"], scope: "warehouse" },
    { resource: "categories", actions: ["read"], scope: "global" },
    { resource: "warehouses", actions: ["read"], scope: "warehouse" }, // ✅ ADDED
  ],
},
```

### **3. Fixed TypeScript Linter Errors**

#### **Added Proper Typing**:

```typescript
export function getAccessibleRoutes(
  userRole: UserRole,
  userWarehouseId?: string
) {
  const routes: Array<{ path: string; name: string; icon: string }> = []; // ✅ ADDED TYPING
  // ... rest of function
}
```
