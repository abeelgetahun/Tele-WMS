# RBAC Fixes Summary - Manager and Clerk Roles

## 🚨 Issues Identified and Fixed

### **Problem 1: Clerk Dashboard Showing Transfer Options**

**Issue**: Clerks were seeing "New Transfer" buttons and transfer-related functionality, which is incorrect.

**Root Cause**:

- Clerk permissions included `transfers: ["create", "read"]`
- Dashboard was showing transfer creation options
- Sidebar included transfer management for clerks

**Fix Applied**:

- ✅ Updated permissions: `transfers: ["read"]` only (no create)
- ✅ Removed transfer creation buttons from Clerk Dashboard
- ✅ Focused Clerk Dashboard on inventory management only
- ✅ Updated sidebar to show only inventory-related actions for clerks

### **Problem 2: Manager Dashboard Not Working Properly**

**Issue**: Manager dashboard wasn't properly fetching warehouse-scoped data and missing key management features.

**Root Cause**:

- Dashboard was using generic API calls instead of warehouse-scoped ones
- Missing team member management functionality
- No proper transfer approval interface

**Fix Applied**:

- ✅ Updated Manager Dashboard to fetch warehouse-scoped data
- ✅ Added team member management section
- ✅ Enhanced transfer approval functionality
- ✅ Added proper warehouse-specific stats calculation
- ✅ Added quick actions for management tasks

### **Problem 3: Sidebar Navigation Issues**

**Issue**: Sidebar wasn't properly filtering based on actual role permissions.

**Root Cause**:

- Generic route generation without role-specific filtering
- Missing role-specific quick actions

**Fix Applied**:

- ✅ Added role-specific quick actions section
- ✅ Manager: "Manage Staff", "Approve Transfers"
- ✅ Clerk: "Add Inventory", "Update Stock"
- ✅ Admin: "Manage Users", "Manage Warehouses"
- ✅ Proper permission-based route filtering

## 🔧 Detailed Fixes

### **1. Updated Permissions (`lib/permissions.ts`)**

```typescript
INVENTORY_CLERK: {
  permissions: [
    { resource: "transfers", actions: ["read"], scope: "warehouse" }, // ✅ Only read
  ];
}

WAREHOUSE_MANAGER: {
  permissions: [
    { resource: "users", actions: ["read", "create"], scope: "warehouse" }, // ✅ Can create staff
    {
      resource: "transfers",
      actions: ["create", "read", "update", "approve"],
      scope: "warehouse",
    }, // ✅ Full transfer management
  ];
